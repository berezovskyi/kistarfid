\section{System Description}
The goal of this project is to construct a passive soft-tag from scratch using a low-power PIC12 microcontroller
This platform will serve as a testbed for estimation of power budget available to a passive tag,
and as a platform for attaching sensors and/or actuators powered by the passive tag, and controller
over RFID via the microcontroller.

\section{Benefits}
Passive tags in their nature have strict power budget constraints, as the RF energy from the reader is limited
and as the transaction times are relatively short, usually less than a second. This project aims to explore
what extensions could be done on a passive tags regarding extra periphials that could be accessed using an RFID reader.


\section{Tasks}


\section{Required Resources}

Access to the PCB mill and various sensors will be required to to real tests of the platform, as hardware needs to be constructed.
Additionally, a working multimeter and access to an RFID reader will be requried to evaluate the performance of the constructed tag.
The microcontroller that will be used is already ordered and available, other sensors will be taken from the labs component storage.
