\section{Project description and application}
The goal of the project is to use a general purpose microcontroller as an RFID soft-tag in the 13.56 MHz band.
The system will use inductive coupling to communicate with the reader and the tag will be completely passive, getting all its power from the reader's magnetic field.
Using a general purpose microcontroller enables more complex tasks to be performed by the RFID tag, such as reading a sensor or operating an actuator on the tag.

In the project, an accelerometer was attached to the tag, used to sense the orientation of the tag when held up against the reader.
